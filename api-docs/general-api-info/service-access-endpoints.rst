Service Access Endpoints
------------------------

The |apiservice| is a regionalized service. The user of the service is therefore responsible 
for selecting the appropriate regional endpoint to ensure access to servers, networks, or 
other Cloud services.

.. tip:: To help you decide which regionalized endpoint to use, read about
   :how-to:`special considerations<about-regions>` for choosing a data center.

If you are working with cloud servers that are in one of the Rackspace data centers, using 
the ``ServiceNet`` endpoint in the same data center has no network costs and provides a 
faster connection. ``ServiceNet`` is the data center internet network. In your authentication 
response service catalog, it is listed as ``InternalURL``. 

If you are working with servers that are not in one of the Rackspace data centers, you must 
use a public endpoint to connect. In your authentication response, public endpoints are listed 
as ``publicURL``. If you are working with servers in multiple data centers or have a mixed 
environment where you have servers in your data centers and in Rackspace data centers, use 
a public endpoint because it is accessible from all the servers in the different environments.

.. tip::
   If you do not know your account ID or which data center you are working in, you can find 
   that information in your :mycloud:`Cloud Control Panel<>`.
   
Use one of the following service access/endpoint to access the |apiservice| service: 

+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Region                  | Endpoint                                                  |

.. note::
   
   You should copy the base URLs directly from the catalog rather than trying to construct 
   them manually. You can find the complete URI to access the Cloud Images API  in the 
   service catalog returned in the :ref:`authentication response <review-auth-resp>`. 
   Search the catalog for the service name, ``cloudImages``. Then copy the URI from the 
   *publicURL* field included in the service information. 

   Rackspace Cloud Identity returns a service catalog, which includes regional endpoints with 
   your account ID. Your account ID, also known as project ID or tenant ID, refers to your 
   Rackspace account number.
